# Boilerplate: Neutralino with Svelte and Typescript

To use this boilerplate:

- clone this repo
- install the dependencies: `yarn install`
- install neutralino globally (see [Neutralino Getting Started](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/getting-started/your-first-neutralinojs-app)): `npm install -g @neutralinojs/neu`
- setup neutralino for the project: `neu update`
- run the project in development mode: `npm run dev`
- build the project: `npm run build`

_Note: This boilerplate doesn't use Vite (default Svelte project now use Vite) but rollup when in dev mode since I didn't figure out how to enable hot reload using Vite with Neutralino. If you have an idea on how to do that, let me know!_
